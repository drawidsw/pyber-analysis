# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to examine the ride sharing data and analyze the differences of the revenue generated across three different types of geographic locations:

* Urban
* Suburban
* Rural

# Analysis and Results

## Description of the Dataset

We are provided with two different datasets.
* **City data**: This data set contains names of cities, types (urban, suburban or rural) and the total driver count in each city. There are a total of 120 records in this data set.
* **Ride data**: This data contains actual rides taken with the timestamp, city in which the ride took place, and the fare collected for each ride. There are a total of 2375 records in this data set.

## Summary of Data by City Type

The table below summarizes various ride data metrics aggregated for the three types of geophraphic locations.

|   | Total Rides | Total Drivers	| Total Fare	| Average Fare per Ride	| Average Fare per Driver |
| - | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | 
| **Rural** | 125 | 78 | $4,327.93 | $34.62 | $55.49 |
| **Suburban** | 625 | 490 | $19,356.33 | $30.97 | $39.50 |
| **Urban** | 1625 | 2,405 | $39,854.38	| $24.53 | $16.57 |

* **Total Rides**: total rides are the most for urban cities and the least for rural towns.
* **Total Drivers**: total drivers are the most for urban cities and the least for rural towns.
* **Total Fare**: total fare collected is the most in urban cities and the least for rural towns. However, the total fare doesn't tell the whole story; we must normalize it to find the fare per ride and per driver.
* **Average Fare per Ride**: The average fare per ride is now flipped with rural towns netting the most fare per ride and urban cities netting the least. The most likely reason is that distances travelled in the rural areas are more than those in urban cities.
* **Average Fare per Driver**: The rural area driver collects the most fare, whereas the urban city driver collects the least.

## Plotting the Trend for the First Four Months of 2019

The graph below shows the trend of total fare for the first four months of 2019 for each of the three types of cities.

# Summary

As seen from the data, city drivers are collecting the least fare and each city ride is also the lowest fare generator. The following recommendations are made to address the situation.

* **Analyze**: To understand why each city ride is netting the least revenue, the duration and distance travelled for each ride should be collected and analyzed. It is hypothesized that most city rides are of short distances and duration. Second, there seem to be too many drivers in the cities competing for the same rides; thus, the revenue generated by each driver seem to be less. 
* **Implement**: There are a few ways in which city rides could be made more profitable. For short distances, a surcharge of a constant amount could be added to each ride. Also, drivers in cities could be encouraged to take their services to nearby suburbs or rural towns. We could give each driver a suggestion by proposing such nearby towns.
* **Optimize**: Finally, we could run a continous data analysis, whereupon we could relocate drivers to nearby profitable routes and spread them across in such a manner so that the total revenue generated by our service could be maximized. For this to work, we would have to also get more data including distances between cities, and drivers preferences on how far they are willing to travel.
